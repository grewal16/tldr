*   **Developer-Friendly Workflow**: Features robust CI/CD pipelines, linting, and development container configurations to streamline contributions and maintain high-quality standards.
*   **Portable Documentation**: Easily generate platform-specific PDF documentation from the source files for offline reference or custom distribution.

## Who is this for?
`tldr-pages` is an essential resource for:
*   **Software Developers**: Quickly recall command syntax for git, Docker, Node.js, Python, and more.
*   **System Administrators**: Troubleshoot and manage systems efficiently with instant access to common network, disk, and process commands.
*   **DevOps Engineers**: Accelerate your daily tasks with quick references for Kubernetes (`kubectl`), cloud CLIs (`aws`, `az`, `gcloud`), and automation tools.
*   **CLI Enthusiasts**: Discover new flags and patterns, or simply refresh your memory on less-frequently used commands.
*   **Learners**: A gentle introduction to complex command-line tools, showing practical usage before deep diving into full man pages.

## Technology Stack & Architecture
At its core, `tldr-pages` leverages:
*   **Content**: Markdown (`.md`) for easily readable and maintainable command examples.
*   **Build & Automation**: Python (`scripts/*.py`), Shell scripting (`scripts/*.sh`), and Node.js (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `scripts/build-index.js`) for content processing, validation, and generation.
*   **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows`) orchestrates automated checks, content validation, and deployment.
*   **Developer Experience**: Visual Studio Code DevContainers (`.devcontainer`) provide a consistent and isolated development environment.
*   **Quality Assurance**: Tools like `flake8`, `codespell`, and `markdownlint` ensure code and content quality.
*   **Documentation Generation**: Custom Python scripts and CSS (`scripts/pdf/`) facilitate the creation of high-quality PDF outputs.
