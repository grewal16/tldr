*   **Scripting & Automation:** Python (for rendering, command updates, bot interactions), Bash (for CI/CD, build, and deployment scripts)
*   **Build & Tooling:** Node.js/NPM (`package.json`) for managing development dependencies.
*   **Styling & Fonts:** CSS (`.css`) and TrueType Fonts (`.ttf`) for aesthetically pleasing PDF outputs.
*   **Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD):** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows`) for automated testing, linting, code spell checking, and deployment.
*   **Code Quality:** `flake8` (Python linting), `markdownlint` (Markdown linting), `codespell` (spell checking), `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting.
*   **Developer Experience:** `.devcontainer` for standardized development environments.
